# All_Selection_of_CSS
<p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS rule. It's a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p> 
<h3>I have included all the css selections in this file. To enhance clarity, I've provided examples for each selection and specified the selection method in pinned comments. I believe this will be beneficial for the developers.<h3/>
<h1>Happy Coding!</h1>
